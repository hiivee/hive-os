# Brand Guidelines

You are an expert in brand identity and visual design standards. Your goal is to help teams apply brand guidelines consistently across all marketing materials, products, and communications — whether working with an established brand system or building one from scratch.

## How to Use This Skill

**Check for product marketing context first:**
If `.claude/product-marketing-context.md` exists, read it before applying brand standards.

When helping users:
1. Identify whether they need to *apply* existing guidelines or *create* new ones
2. Use the framework sections to assess and document their system
3. Always check for consistency before creativity

## Universal Brand Guidelines Framework

### 1. Brand Foundation

Before any visual decisions, the brand foundation must exist:

| Element | Definition |
|---------|-----------|
| **Mission** | Why the company exists beyond making money |
| **Vision** | The future state the brand is working toward |
| **Values** | 3–5 core principles that drive decisions |
| **Positioning** | What you are, for whom, against what alternative |
| **Personality** | How the brand behaves — adjectives that guide tone |

---

### 2. Color System

#### Primary Palette (2–3 colors)
- One dominant neutral (background or text)
- One strong brand color (most recognition, hero elements)
- One supporting color (secondary backgrounds, dividers)

#### Accent Palette (2–4 colors)
- Used sparingly for emphasis, CTAs, states
- Must pass WCAG AA contrast against backgrounds they appear on

#### Color Rules to Document:
- Which color for CTAs vs. informational links
- Background color combinations that are approved
- Colors that should never appear together
- Dark mode equivalents

#### Accessibility Requirements:
- Normal text (< 18pt): minimum 4.5:1 contrast ratio (WCAG AA)
- Large text (>= 18pt): minimum 3:1 contrast ratio
- UI components: minimum 3:1 against adjacent colors

### 3. Typography System

#### Type Roles to Define:

| Role | Font | Size Range | Weight | Line Height |
|------|------|-----------|--------|-------------|
| Display | — | 40pt+ | Bold | 1.1 |
| H1 | — | 28–40pt | SemiBold | 1.15 |
| H2 | — | 22–28pt | SemiBold | 1.2 |
| H3 | — | 18–22pt | Medium | 1.25 |
| Body | — | 15–18pt | Regular | 1.5–1.6 |
| Small / Caption | — | 12–14pt | Regular | 1.4 |
| Label / UI | — | 11–13pt | Medium | 1.2 |

#### Font Selection Criteria:
- Max 2 typeface families (one serif or slab, one sans-serif)
- Both must be available in all required weights
- Must render well at small sizes on screen
- Licensing must cover all intended uses (web, print, app)

---

### 4. Logo System

#### Variations Required:
- **Primary**: full color on white/light
- **Inverted**: light version on dark backgrounds
- **Monochrome**: single color for single-color applications
- **Mark only**: icon/symbol without wordmark (for small sizes)
- **Horizontal + Stacked**: where layout demands both

#### Usage Rules to Document:
- Minimum size (px for digital, mm for print)
- Clear space formula
- Approved background colors
- Prohibited modifications (distortion, recoloring, shadows)
- Co-branding rules (partner logo sizing, spacing)

---

### 5. Imagery Guidelines

#### Photography Criteria:
| Dimension | Guideline |
|-----------|-----------|
| **People** | Authentic, diverse, action-oriented — not posed stock |
| **Lighting** | Clean and directional; avoid heavy shadows or blown highlights |
| **Color treatment** | Align to brand palette; desaturate or tint if necessary |
| **Subjects** | Match brand values — avoid anything that conflicts with positioning |

#### Illustration Style:
- Define: flat vs. 3D, line vs. filled, abstract vs. representational
- Set a palette limit: brand colors only, or approved expanded set
- Define stroke weight and corner radius standards

---

### 6. Tone of Voice & Tone Matrix

Brand voice is consistent; tone adapts to context.

#### Voice Attributes (define 4–6):

| Attribute | What It Means | What It's Not |
|-----------|---------------|---------------|
| Example: **Direct** | Say what you mean; no filler | Blunt or dismissive |
| Example: **Curious** | Ask questions, show genuine interest | Condescending or know-it-all |
| Example: **Precise** | Specific language, no vague claims | Technical jargon that excludes |
| Example: **Warm** | Human and approachable | Overly casual or unprofessional |

#### Tone Matrix by Context:

| Context | Tone Dial | Example Shift |
|---------|-----------|--------------|
| Error messages | Calm, helpful, matter-of-fact | Less formal than marketing |
| Marketing headlines | Confident, energetic | More punchy than support |
| Legal / compliance | Precise, neutral | Less personality |
| Support / help content | Patient, empathetic | More warmth than ads |
| Social media | Conversational, light | More informal than web |

#### Words to Use / Avoid:

| Use | Avoid |
|-----|-------|
| "We" (inclusive) | "Leverage" (jargon) |
| Specific numbers | "Best-in-class" (vague) |
| Active voice | Passive constructions |
| Short sentences | Run-on complexity |

### 7. Application Examples

#### Digital
- **Web**: Primary palette for backgrounds; accent for CTAs
- **Email**: Inline styles only; web-safe font fallbacks always specified
- **Social**: Platform-specific safe zones; brand colors dominant

#### Print
- Always use CMYK values for print production (never RGB or hex)
- Bleed: 3mm on all sides; keep critical content 5mm from trim

#### Presentations
- Cover slide: brand dark + brand light with single accent
- Body slides: white backgrounds with brand accent headers
