// Canonical review workflow for hive-os. Copy this, swap the DIMENSIONS, run it.
//
// THE SHAPE (one writer, many scouts. See harness/orchestration/README.md):
//
//   DIMENSIONS ─► pipeline:
//                   stage 1: agent() reviews one dimension  -> findings[]
//                   stage 2: parallel() of N skeptics       -> verdict per finding
//                 ─► keep only findings the skeptics could NOT refute
//
//   +------------+   review     +-----------+  adversarial verify  +-----------+
//   | bugs       | ───────────► | findings  | ───────────────────► | confirmed |
//   | security   |   (agent)    | per dim   |   (parallel skeptics)| findings  |
//   | perf       |              +-----------+                      +-----------+
//   +------------+
//
// Review is read-heavy and independent: each dimension is a scout, conclusions
// merge cleanly. This is exactly the "fan out to READ and VERIFY" case. We never
// fan out to WRITE: nothing here edits a file, so no worktree isolation, no merge
// hell. The single writer (you, or a downstream fix script) integrates after.

// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// meta: every workflow exports this. The harness reads it to label the run and
// render progress. phases[] are the user-visible stages of THIS script.
