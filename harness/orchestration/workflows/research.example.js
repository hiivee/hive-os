// research.example.js
//
// A runnable hive-os workflow: a multi-modal research/audit fan-out that runs
// loop-until-dry, then hands off to a completeness critic. Copy this file,
// swap the angles and the schemas for your target, and ship.
//
// What it teaches (the four moves you will reuse everywhere):
//   1. FAN OUT TO READ. Spawn finders across different search ANGLES in
//      parallel. Reading and verifying parallelize cleanly (Anthropic
//      "Multi-Agent Research System"). Writing does not, so there is no writer
//      here. One writer, many scouts. This script is all scouts.
//   2. DEDUP IN PLAIN CODE, not in an agent. A Set lives in the harness. The
//      harness is deterministic and free; an agent asked to "remember what we
//      have seen" is neither. Never spend a context window on bookkeeping a
//      `Set` does in one line.
//   3. LOOP UNTIL DRY. Keep spawning rounds until K consecutive rounds add
//      nothing new, then stop. The corpus tells you when it is exhausted. Beats
//      a guessed --top-N that truncates real results or burns runs on an empty
//      tail.
//   4. COMPLETENESS CRITIC. One final agent asks "what MODALITY did we miss?"
//      It does not redo the work. It checks coverage: which lens never ran,
//      which input got skipped, which assumption stayed unverified. The guard
//      against a confident-but-partial result.
//
// THE KEY TRAP (read this twice):
//   Dedup against EVERYTHING SEEN, not just confirmed findings. If you only add
//   a finding to `seen` after a verifier confirms it, every rejected duplicate
//   stays "unseen" and comes back next round. The loop re-finds the same junk
//   forever and the dry counter never advances. It NEVER converges. Mark a
//   candidate seen the instant a finder emits it. Verification decides whether
//   it ships, not whether it counts as seen. Seen is about convergence;
//   confirmed is about quality. Two different jobs, two different sets.
//
// Hooks the harness injects (same surface as pipeline.example.js):
//   agent({ name, prompt, schema, model?, tools?, maxTurns? }) -> Promise<result>
//       Spawns ONE subagent in a fresh context window. Returns the parsed
//       structured result matching `schema`. Subagents are one level deep:
//       a subagent cannot call agent() again (coordinator + workers topology).
//   parallel(tasks) -> Promise<results[]>
//       Runs an array of () => agent(...) thunks concurrently (barrier: waits
//       for ALL before returning). Use it when a stage needs the whole set,
//       which a per-round dedup does. Concurrency is capped by the harness
//       (~16 at once); it queues the rest, it does not silently drop them.
//   log(...args) -> void
//       Structured run log. Use it at every boundary. A fan-out you cannot
//       replay from the log is a fan-out you cannot trust.

// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Why these choices (the senior-engineer footnotes):
//
// * Two sets, not one. `seen` (convergence) and the confirmed/shipped set
//   (quality) are different jobs. Conflating them is THE bug that kills the
//   loop. If you remember one thing from this file, remember that.
//
// * Dedup is plain code, never an agent. The harness is deterministic, free,
//   and instant. An agent asked to "track what we've seen" forgets across
//   rounds (fresh context each spawn) and costs tokens to do worse what a Set
//   does perfectly. Bookkeeping is the harness's job; thinking is the agent's.
//
// * parallel() (barrier) here, not pipeline(). The default everywhere else is
//   pipeline (no barrier, item streaming). But per-round dedup needs the WHOLE
//   round before it can judge novelty, so this is the legitimate barrier case.
//   Don't cargo-cult parallel() onto stages that don't need all prior results;
//   it just makes you wait for the slowest finder for nothing.
//
// * Finders on haiku, critic on sonnet. Finders are many and cheap and bounded;
//   the critic does the one genuinely hard judgment (coverage of the angle list
//   itself), so it gets the better model. Match model spend to the difficulty
//   of the call, not uniformly.
//
// * Read-only, one level deep. No agent here writes or edits (this is the READ
//   side of the split: fan out to read, single-thread to write). And no finder
//   calls agent() (subagents are one level deep, coordinator + workers). If you
//   want the findings ACTED ON, the single writer is the caller of this run(),
//   not a worker inside it.
